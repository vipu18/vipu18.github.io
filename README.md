## Deploy your own digital resume

1. clone repo `git clone https://github.com/divanov11/Digital-Resume` & update content to represent your information
2. Create a new github repo
3. Commit and push to github.

```
git add .
git commit -m "your commit notes"
git push -u origin main
```

4. Publish with github pages

Once you've added your project to GitHub, you can publish by going to the `settings` tab from your repo (this should be in the top right corner), then select `pages` (this should be towards the bottom left).

From here make sure you have "deploy from branch" selected and save your settings. Once saved, it should take a few minutes to generate and display your new live GitHub pages url.
